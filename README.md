# WEBSAGE
Websage is an AI-based project that combines web scraping, vector embeddings, and generative AI to extract and analyze web content. The tool enables users to scrape data from any webpage, store it in a vector database (MILVUS), and query the stored data with questions, generating insightful answers using GEMINI.
